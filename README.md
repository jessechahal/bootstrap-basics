# bootstrap-basics
Project to test out some bootstrap basics

## Purpose
This project is just for experimenting with bootstrap to see what all the fuss is about.
Will eventually use bootstrap in Stytch (my employer at the time of writing)  on aws to host 
a simple UI for automated deployments to test clusters. If that project evolves to actually
being useful then we might even end up using it for production deployments o_O
